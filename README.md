# Go job search
<hr>

A **REST API** that allows registering as users and employers, where both
account types have access to different endpoints and are allowed to perform
different actions (e.g. only employers can create job offers, and only users
can create job applications).
Search functionality is implemented both with Postgres and Elasticsearch (depending on search complexity).
<hr>

### Built in Go 1.20

### The app uses:
- Postgres
- Docker
- [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch)
- [golang-migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate)
- [sqlc](https://github.com/kyleconroy/sqlc)
- [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify)
- [PASETO Security Tokens](github.com/o1egl/paseto)
- [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
- [gin-swagger](https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger)

<hr>

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository
2. Go to the project's root directory
3. Rename `app.env.example` to `app.env` and replace the values
4. Run in your terminal:
     - `docker-compose up` to run the database container
     - `make migrate_up` - to run migrations
     - `make runserver` - to run HTTP server
5. Now everything should be ready and server running on `SERVER_ADDRESS` specified in `app.env`
<hr>

## Testing
1. Run the postgres container (`docker-compose up`)
2. Run in your terminal:
    - `make test` to run all tests

   or
    - `make test_coverage p={PATH}` - to get the coverage in the HTML format - where `{PATH}` is the path to the target directory for which you want to generate test coverage. The `{PATH}` should be replaced with the actual path you want to use. For example `./api`

   or
    - use standard `go test` commands (e.g. `go test -v ./internal/api`)
<hr>

## API endpoints
This API provides a set of endpoints for managing:
- users
- employers
- jobs
- job applications

(and indirectly: user skills and job skills)


After running the server, the Swagger documentation is available at http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html. 
You can find there detailed information about the API endpoints, including their parameters, 
request and response formats, and examples. You can use the Swagger UI to test the API 
endpoints and see their responses in real-time.
